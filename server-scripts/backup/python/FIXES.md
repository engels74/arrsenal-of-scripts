# Backup Script Fixes

This document describes the fixes applied to `overengineered-backup-script.py` to address the three issues identified.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Discord "View Logs" Link Issue

**Problem**: The Discord success notification showed "ðŸ”— View Logs" but didn't include the actual privatebin link.

**Location**: Line 1187 in the success message formatting

**Fix**: Changed from:
```python
if privatebin_link:
    message += "ðŸ”— View Logs\n\n"
```

To:
```python
if privatebin_link:
    message += f"ðŸ”— **[View Logs]({privatebin_link})**\n\n"
```

**Result**: The Discord notification now includes a clickable markdown link to the privatebin log.

### 2. PV Progress Output Not in Logs

**Problem**: The `pv` command output was only shown on console and not captured in the log file.

**Location**: Lines 942-956 in the `create_backup` function

**Fix**: 
- Added threading support to capture `pv` stderr output
- Created a temporary log file for `pv` output
- Added a background thread to read `pv` progress and log it
- Properly redirected `pv` stderr to a file and then to the main log

**Result**: `pv` progress is now captured in the log file with "Progress: " prefix.

### 3. Log File Ownership Issue

**Problem**: Log files were created as root but should be owned by the BACKUP_USER.

**Location**: Added new function and call in main()

**Fix**:
- Added `set_log_permissions()` function (lines 1139-1152)
- Added call to `set_log_permissions(log_file)` after log setup (line 1178)
- Function sets ownership to BACKUP_USER:BACKUP_GROUP with 644 permissions

**Result**: Log files are now properly owned by the configured backup user.

## Additional Improvements

- Added `threading` import for the pv progress logging functionality
- Fixed unused call result warnings by adding `_` assignments
- Added comprehensive tests to verify all fixes work correctly
- Maintained backward compatibility and error handling

## Testing

All fixes have been tested with:
- Unit tests in `test_fixes.py`
- Type safety verification with `basedpyright`
- TDD approach ensuring fixes work as expected

The fixes maintain the existing functionality while addressing the specific issues without breaking changes.
