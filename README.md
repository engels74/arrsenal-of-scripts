# Arrsenal of Scripts

*A bunch of scripts for server stuff, 'arr' apps, and whatever else I needed along the way.*

## 🚀 About the Repo

This is a collection of scripts I’ve thrown together for managing servers, automating tasks, and tinkering with apps like **Sonarr**, **Radarr**, **Prowlarr**, and more. It’s mostly for personal use, but feel free to adapt it to your needs.

## 📂 What You'll Find

- **'Arr' App Scripts**: Odd scripts for the "Servarr" app suite
- **Server Management Tools**: Odd scripts for my personal server management

- **Other Tools**: Whatever else made sense to throw in here.
